## Overview
**Guardian-Eye.AI** is an AI-powered surveillance system designed to enhance public safety by detecting violent activities in real-time. Using **computer vision and deep learning**, this system integrates with existing surveillance infrastructure to identify threats, send alerts, and enable **rapid response** to critical incidents.

## Key Features
- ‚úÖ **Real-Time Violence Detection** ‚Äì Utilizes **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for high-speed and accurate detection.
- ‚úÖ **FastAPI-Powered Backend** ‚Äì Provides a **lightweight, efficient API** for both web and mobile integration.
- ‚úÖ **Live Video Streaming** ‚Äì Streams processed video with detected threats **overlaid on the feed**.
- ‚úÖ **Incident Logging** ‚Äì Automatically records **date, time, severity, and detection confidence** for review.
- ‚úÖ **Automated Alerts** ‚Äì Sends **real-time alerts via Telegram** and triggers emergency calls using **Millis AI/Twilio**.
- ‚úÖ **Configurable Settings** ‚Äì Adjust alert thresholds, detection confidence, and contact details via an intuitive web dashboard.
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Alert Escalation** ‚Äì Triggers review alerts for MILD cases and automatically escalates to HIGH severity if 5 consecutive MILD detections occur.
- ‚úÖ **Web Dashboard (HTMX + FastAPI)** ‚Äì Provides a responsive UI with **live status updates** and incident history.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- A working webcam (or adjust the code for a different video source)
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) ‚Äì **Required for downloading large model files.** Make sure Git LFS is installed before cloning the model repository.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SHASWATSINGH3101/GUARDIAN-EYE.AI.git
cd GUARDIAN-EYE.AI
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Download Pre-trained Models
Models are hosted on Hugging Face. To download them:
```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/SHASWATSINGH3101/GAURDIAN_EYE_AI
```
After cloning, update the model paths in your `app/config.py`:
```python
MODEL1_PATH = "GAURDIAN_EYE_AI/model1/best.pt"
MODEL2_PATH = "GAURDIAN_EYE_AI/model2/best.pt"
MODEL3_PATH = "GAURDIAN_EYE_AI/model3/best.pt"
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Setting up Telegram Alerts
1. Create a new bot on Telegram using [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Get your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.
3. Update the following in your configuration (e.g., in `app/config.py`):
    ```python
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "your_bot_token_here"
    TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "your_chat_id_here"
    ```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Using Twilio and Millis AI
This project comes with trial account credentials for **Twilio** and **Millis AI** to get you started quickly. These keys are included in the configuration but are limited to trial credits.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**
These are trial account credentials with limited credits. For more control or if the trial credits expire, create your own accounts:
- [Twilio Account Setup](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
- [Millis AI Account Setup](https://www.millis.ai/)

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application
```bash
uvicorn main_fastapi:app --reload
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Git LFS Issues:** Ensure Git LFS is installed before cloning the model repository.
- **Webcam Access:** If you encounter errors accessing your webcam, verify that your system permissions are correctly set or modify the video source in the code.
- **Port Conflicts:** If the server does not start, ensure port 8000 (or the port specified in your configuration) is not in use or adjust the command accordingly.
- **Dependency Conflicts:** Use a virtual environment to prevent package conflicts.
