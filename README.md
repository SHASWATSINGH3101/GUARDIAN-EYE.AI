## Overview
**Guardian-Eye.AI** is an AI-powered surveillance system designed to enhance public safety by detecting violent activities in real-time. Using **computer vision and deep learning**, this system integrates with existing surveillance infrastructure to identify threats, send alerts, and enable **rapid response** to critical incidents.

## Key Features
✅ **Real-Time Violence Detection** – Uses **YOLO** (You Only Look Once) for high-speed and accurate detection.  
✅ **FastAPI-Powered Backend** – Ensures a **lightweight, efficient API** for web and mobile integration.  
✅ **Live Video Streaming** – Streams processed video with detected threats **overlaid on the feed**.  
✅ **Incident Logging** – Automatically records **date, time, severity, and detection confidence** for review.  
✅ **Automated Alerts** – Sends **real-time alerts via Telegram & emergency calls (Millis AI/Twilio)**.  
✅ **Configurable Settings** – Users can **adjust alert thresholds, detection confidence, and contact details**.  
✅ **Web Dashboard (HTMX + FastAPI)** – Provides a responsive UI with **live status updates**.

## Usage

### **1️⃣ Access the Web Dashboard**
Once the server is running, open a browser and visit:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

### **2️⃣ Key Endpoints**
| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/` | Dashboard showing live detection and alerts |
| `/video_feed` | Streams the processed video feed |
| `/status_view` | Returns the current detection status (HTMX) |
